# Autonomous-Systems-Using-NetworkX
Five autonomous systems (ASs), with an equal number of nodes assigned to each AS for a network consisting of 100 nodes. 
In this project, we aimed to create and analyze five autonomous systems (ASs), with an equal number of nodes assigned to each AS for a network consisting of 100 nodes. We used both inter-AS and intra-AS routing protocols to find the optimal path from the source to the destination, considering link cost and bandwidth as metric. In addition, we checked the optimal path using the hot-potato routing method. We present the results of our analysis and discuss the implications of our findings.
